Whatsfree
========

Very simple script to find/check for a free IP address to use on your local subnet.

Why?

During pentests you are sometimes not given a free IP address to scan from, or you are given a free IP address but you want to ensure it is not in use.

Ever set your IP address to one that a client gives you and find it is in use?

You do not need to set an IP address, just run this simple script and it will work out the range that should be there and arpscan to find what is in use. It will then display what IP addresses are free.
